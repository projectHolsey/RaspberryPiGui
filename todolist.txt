Listing some items for this project's to do Listing

( Luckily, the older me dealth with most of the API stuff so i don't need to go back in and get more data... Kinda just need to format the styles on the page )

# 1 - 
    - Go through with suzi to find what items we might want displayed on screen
    - make a list of what would and wouldn't be useful
        - E.g - Something saying whether we need the garbage taking out
        - E.g - Random brazilian word to learn
        - E.g - todo list

# 2 -
    - split the page into 4 items instead of just 2
        - Make them equal in height and width
        ... Or make a full new layout

# 3 - Decide what kind of icons we want, and download a bunch of them for use 
    - E.g Bin icons
    - E.g weather icons..

#4 - Make new layouts for each of the items, explaining what we want in each of them
